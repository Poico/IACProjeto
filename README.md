# IACProjeto

Project for IAC subject at IST.
May - June 2023

## The project

The goal of this project was to develop a game in assembly for the provided PEPE-16 processor.  
The game proposed by our teachers was entitled Beyond Mars: a simple game where a ship had to shoot asteroids to defend itself and regain energy.
Our group decided to develop a completely different game. We went for a Tetris clone.
